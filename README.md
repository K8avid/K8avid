## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th-year student in Cybersecurity passionate about Offensive Security (Red Team) and have interest in OSINT investigation.

Every weekend, you'll find me solving CTF challenges. I'm always eager to learn, improve my skills, and explore the world of hacking.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects!
